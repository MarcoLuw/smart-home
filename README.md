# SMART HOME PROJECT
This is a project for smart home integrated face recognition and automatically door, led.

Note that there are some features which can not be set as public. So don't worry, it doesn't affect much the performance of this app.

- Run file **Access.py** to test both the capture login and streaming login. Using any images in folder *member_image*.
- Run file **dashboard.py** to test interface for users as host, and also visualization of data.
- File **Register.py** is only used for host to register new member so that camera could detect. It's required account for admin. I will be provided until I have finished creating pulic testing environment.
